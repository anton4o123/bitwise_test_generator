####To use the program you must compile it and then run it.

##Requirements:

In order to compile you must have the SDL library for c++. You can install it typing:
```
sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev
```
In order to work properly and use it completely you must have wkhtmltopdf:
```
sudo apt-get install wkhtmltopdf
```
#Compilation:

To compile just type:
```
make
```
When compiled run the program from the icon or type:
```
./generator
```
There are instructions how to use in the program itself.
